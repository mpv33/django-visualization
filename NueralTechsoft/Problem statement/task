Performing Technical Analysis.
Given a price series as a list
1. Calculate the Simple Moving Average(SMA) of the price(P).
(Accept the time period as the input)
2. For every point of the SMA, calculate standard deviation(STD_DEV).
3. Mark an upper band(UB) as SMA+2*STD_DEV
4. Mark a lower band(LB) as SMA-2*STD_DEV
5. IF P>UB, stock is in state A
6. IF UB>=P>=LB, stock is in state B
7. IF P<LB, stock is in state C
